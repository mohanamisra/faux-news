# Faux News Blog Launched! ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢  

Faux News is a 100% legit website to get all your news from.  

Check it out <a href = "https://mohanamisra.github.io/faux-news/">RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW!</a>  

Currently however, it is still in the process of being built. You see, Rome was not built in a day and all good things take time!  
(You know what was built in a day? CMM. And we all know how that turned out... yeesh.)  

Right now this website has just the one article about workplace tips for all the managers out there.  

Stay tuned for more updates, which shall be deployed at the leisure of the happy, optimistic maintainer of this site who always has a completely free schedule (thanks to capitalism and the hustle-culture ^_^).
